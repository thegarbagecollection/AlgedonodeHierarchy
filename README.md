# Algedonode Hierarchy
### Brain of the Firm Chapter 5 (2nd ed.)
### Stafford Beer 

## Introduction
A model / simulation to help readers of BotF understand what Beer is talking about in Chapter 5 - it's long on description and short on explanation.

As far as I can tell, this is reasonably faithful to the machine he discusses, although contact positions may have been different in the real implementations.

## To use
The latest version is available at []()

For desktop use, download the zip and extract; run the file `AlgedonodeHierarchy.html`, all necessary files are included.

The wooden strip positions are controlled by the sliders below the machine, and the dials can be set directly.

## Additions
This implementation has a few extra features that might help in understanding the machine and the various concepts in the chapter.

#### Changing view modes

#### Randomizable contact positions

#### Automatic dial state change

#### Data graphic display
